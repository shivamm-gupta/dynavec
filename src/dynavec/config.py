"""Configuration objects for dynavec.

Everything the client needs to talk to *the user's own* AWS account lives here.
No data leaves the account: DynamoDB + S3 Vectors are both regional AWS services
and dynavec only ever calls them with the caller's credentials.

class DynavecConfig:
    """Top-level configuration for a :class:`~dynavec.client.Dynavec` client.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vector_bucket:
        Name of the S3 vector bucket (created if ``auto_provision=True``).
    index:
        Name of the vector index within the bucket.
    table:
        DynamoDB table name for the document / metadata store.
    dimension:
        Embedding dimension. Must match the embedder and the S3 Vectors index.
    distance_metric:
        ``"cosine"`` (default) or ``"euclidean"``.
    region:
        AWS region. Falls back to the standard boto3 resolution if ``None``.
    filterable_keys:
        Metadata keys that should be pushed into S3 Vectors so they can be used
        as pre-filters during ANN search. Everything else lives only in
        DynamoDB. Keep this list small — S3 Vectors caps filterable metadata size
        per vector. ``None`` (default) means "push all metadata keys as
        filterable" (fine for small metadata; not recommended with large text).
    store_text_in_s3vectors:
        If True, mirror a truncated copy of the source text into S3 Vectors as
        *non-filterable* metadata. Off by default — the canonical text lives in
        DynamoDB, which is cheaper to read and has no per-vector size cap.
    over_fetch:
        Multiplier applied to ``top_k`` when reranking is enabled, so the
        reranker has a candidate pool to work with.
    top_k_page_size:
        Optional client-side chunk size for streamed query pages. ``None``
        (default) yields native Amazon S3 Vectors pages (at most 100 vectors).
        Does not change the service page size.
    max_pool_connections:
        Maximum connections retained per botocore connection pool. Defaults to
        10, matching botocore. Applies to the stores, graph, DynamoDB cache, and
        provisioning clients created from this configuration.
